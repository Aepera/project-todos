# Project Todos

This is a To-do web app built in React Redux.

## The problem

The App component renders three child components; header, input form and a task list. Each task added to the list can be marked as done and be removed from the list. 
There are buttons to mark all tasks as done and to delete all tasks. 
The store is in the tasks.js file where the reducers also are found. The initial state items array has two hard coded tasks for demonstration purpose.
